# MSCI_2021_Project2
Develop and use UCL polar altimetry processing chain 

Goal: Use the UCL polar ocean altimetry products to infer changes in the circulation of the polar oceans

Data: Dynamic Ocean Topography (DOT), ocean geostrophic currents, Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE), Ekman current and upwelling (http://www.cpom.ucl.ac.uk/dynamic_topography/)

Tool: the python routines developped by Harry Heorton (DOT_Ekman_manual-master.zip directory in this GitHub)

Winds (reanalysis - daily), geostrophic currents (altimetry - monthly) and sea ice motion (imagery – daily/weekly) remain uncertain. At high latitudes these resolutions can be improved due to high sampling (up to 82N) hence providing a better understanding of air-ice-ocean coupling.
